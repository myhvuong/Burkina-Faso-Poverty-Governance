# Policy Lab Project: Analyzing the Linkage Between Local Poverty and Governance Perceptions in Burkina Faso

### Repository Overview

This repository showcases an example of the work I completed as part of the Harris Policy Lab Project, where I, along with five teammates, served as policy consultants under faculty supervision for our client, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The project's focus was on analyzing disparities in local poverty and its connections with governance perceptions in Burkina Faso to guide the UNDP's resource allocation decisions. 

Included here are R scripts for:

* **Cleaning and Preparing Living Standards Metrics** from household survey data, essential for constructing the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI).

* **Cleaning and Preparing Subjective Poverty** from household survey data, capturing individual household perceptions of poverty. This script complements the MPI by providing a nuanced view of poverty that considers personal experiences and perceptions, enhancing our holistic approach to the analysis.

These efforts supported the creation of our final deliverables: a comprehensive policy memo and a presentation tailored for a non-technical stakeholder audience.
